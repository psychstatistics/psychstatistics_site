## Clinical Services

I offer psychotherapy and behavioral treatment for adults dealing with anxiety, depression, interpersonal problems, and chronic stress. Common anxiety problems include generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and social anxiety. Many clients also experience symptoms of depression. Sometimes these symptoms don't meet criteria for major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, many of the strategies we discuss can be useful in improving your mood.

Homework could be collecting data regarding your thought patterns or the situtations where you feel worst (or the best). Homework can also include implementing skills to engage rather than avoid difficult feelings.
