## Clinical Services

I offer psychotherapy and behavioral treatment for adults dealing with anxiety, depression, interpersonal problems, and chronic stress. Common anxiety problems include generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and social anxiety. Many clients also experience symptoms of depression. Sometimes these symptoms don't meet criteria for major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, many of the strategies we discuss can be useful in improving your mood. 

## An Overview of Treatment

My preferred mode of therapy is called *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy* or CBT. In a nutshell, CBT focuses on helping clients understand how thoughts, behaviors, and emotions combine to create and maintain the problems they are struggling with. Further, CBT provides a framework for helping clients learn skills and rengage with their life in ways consistent with their values. We will work together to identify barriers to living the life you want to live and to develop a plan to address those barriers. You'll have "homework" to focus on during the week. Homework could be collecting data regarding your thought patterns or the situtations where you feel worst (or the best). Homework can also include implementing skills to engage with rather than avoid difficult feelings. 

We will talk about your life (and sometimes your past), similar to how you might have seen therapy portrayed in movies or likely similar to other therapy you've received. Therapy with me is an active process where the key thing that facilitates change is practice. You'll take the principles you learn and discover during sessions and apply them during the week. You'll get to practice new skills and rekindle old ones. The practicd helps you improve your life and develop new thinking patterns, behavioral habits, and emotional coping strategies.
