This page provides Mplus input and output files, as well as data files, for the examples I use in the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) workshop. I also provide a link for the lecture slides. The Mplus files and data are stored on GitHub. For any who are interested, feel free to clone the directory and improve it. I will merge changes as needed.

You can download all the training files in .zip file here: <a href="https://raw.github.com/psychstatistics/sem_training_files/master/SEM_training_examples.zip">SEM Workshop Example Files</a>.

The slides for the presentation can be downloaded here:  <a href="http://www.psychstatistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SEM_ABCT_2013_morning.pdf">SEM_ABCT_2013_morning</a> and <a href="http://www.psychstatistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SEM_ABCT_2013_afternoon.pdf">SEM_ABCT_2013_afternoon</a>

For power there are a ton of examples. I am going to link to a zip file with all the example in them. Please get that here: <a href="https://raw.github.com/psychstatistics/sem_training_files/master/power/power_examples.zip" target="_blank">Power Examples Zip File</a>.
